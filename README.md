# Introduction Extras to Computer Science

Borrows heavily from CS50.

This is a course for giving you proper introduction (_and extras!_) to Computer Science before your university admission. This course is also for people who have been out of touch with either CS, C Programming, or would just like to try CS as a hobby. This course aims to teach you the fundamental elements of CS, and build you a _strong_ foundation for your CS background.

This is a on-site offline course.
